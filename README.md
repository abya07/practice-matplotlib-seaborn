I have used the “crypto_daily_prices.csv” and “crypto_daily_returns.csv” datasets and performed the followings:



Import both datasets using Pandas.

1. Using Matplotlib, plot lineplots that display crypto daily prices on one single figure.

2. Using Matplotlib, plot crypto daily prices on multiple subplots.

3. Using Matplotlib, plot the scatterplot between Bitcoin and Ethereum daily returns.

4. Using Seaborn, plot similar scatterplot between bitcoin and Ethereum daily returns.

5. Assume that you became bullish on XRP and decided to allocate 60% of your assets in it. You
also decided to equally divide the rest of your assets in other coins (BTC, LTC, ADA, and ETH).
Using Matplotlib, plot a pie chart that shows these allocations. Use ‘explode’ attribute to
increase the separation between BTC and the rest of the portfolio.

6. Using Matplotlib, plot the histogram for ETH returns using 30 bins with red color.

7. Using Seaborn, plot a heatmap that shows the correlations between crypto daily returns.
